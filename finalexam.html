    Heretic God Attributes
[Heretic God]
Era of Gods. The Creation God of Elements, one of the four Creation Gods born from the primal powers of the Ancestral God. Possessed the most extreme power of the elements within the Primal Chaos Realm. Able to perfectly control, resist, and absorb the seven basic elemental powers: Light, Darkness, Wind, Fire, Lightning, Water, and Earth. (Light and Darkness were not known to the other gods).
Later, combining with the powers of the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor, he created the “Devil God Forbidden Tome” which could go against the laws of nature. Afterwards, because the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor was mercilessly exiled by Creation God Mo E, he became disheartened, gave up his Creation God title, and called himself the “Heretic God”. The “Devil God Forbidden Tome” was also renamed the “Heretic God Arts”.
